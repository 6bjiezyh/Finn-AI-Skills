# Content Pillars

## Pillar Set

Use only these seven pillars:

1. AI
2. n8n自动化
3. AI工具
4. 扣子
5. Vibe Coding
6. AI赚钱
7. AIGC

## Angle Matrix

For each candidate topic, choose one angle type:

- 新手向: explain concept, setup path, minimum viable workflow.
- 提效向: show time savings, automation patterns, team workflow gains.
- 赚钱向: show service offer, productization path, pricing logic, delivery scope.

## De-duplication Rules

- Treat same tool + same use case + same audience as duplicate.
- Treat minor title rewrites as duplicate.
- If duplicate with recent 7-day history, replace with:
  - a different audience angle, or
  - a different monetization path, or
  - a different business scenario.

## Weekly Balance Guidance

- In any 3-day window, include all seven pillars at least once.
- Keep `n8n自动化` and `AI工具` slightly overrepresented when no priority track is given.
- If `priority_track` exists, allocate 40%-60% of daily ideas to that track.

Total must be 20.

## ExpandedTopicPool20 Topic Shape

Prefer topic families below:

- `AI自动化`: today-build workflow, n8n vs Coze comparison, integration or delivery workflow.
- `Vibe Coding`: small project monetization, tool comparison, new feature usage after updates.
- `AIGC`: e-commerce image/video generation, content pipeline with n8n automation.
