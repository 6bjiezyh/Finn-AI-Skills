# Platform Playbook

## Long Video (Bilibili)

Design long-form ideas for explain-and-convert structure:

1. Hook (problem + promise)
2. Context (why this matters now)
3. Step-by-step method
4. Real scenario or mini case
5. Result and pitfalls
6. CTA to community or custom workflow service

Use length assumptions:

- Typical runtime: 6-15 minutes
- Detail level: medium to deep
- Objective: trust building and conversion

## Short Video (Chinese Short-Form Platforms)

Design short-form ideas for fast-action structure:

1. Pain sentence in first 3 seconds
2. One concrete demo or before/after
3. One key actionable step
4. CTA for link, private message, or community entry

Use length assumptions:

- Typical runtime: 30-60 seconds
- Detail level: focused single point
- Objective: reach + intent capture

## Cross-Platform Rewrite Rule

If one core topic is reused across formats:

- Long video: keep full method and decision context.
- Short video: keep one punchline + one proof + one action.
- Do not copy long-video structure directly into short-video outline.
